### Technology Used

* ES6
* React

## Requirements

Please make sure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. This
application is built with webpack, and without those two tools, you can't proceed.

- Node.js (recommended: 4.x)
- npm (recommended: 2.x or 3.x)

### Installation

Install all the required packages mentiond in package.json:

```ssh
$ npm i

```

After installing all the packages we have to install webpack and webpack-dev-server globally.

```ssh
$ npm i webpack -g

```
And

```ssh
$ npm i webpack-dev-server -g

```

### Navigation app

After Installing necessery packages and debtools we are goint to launch our application to our local server.Just write following command

```ssh
$ npm start

```
```ssh
$ npm run dev

```
After writing these command we will goto the browser and try to access our
application on [http://localhost:8080 ](http://localhost:8080) url.
If every thing goes well, now we will be able see our brand new Todo Manager.


### Features developed by me:

I have developed all the features according to the instruction given:

## WEB-103: Add status filtering test
Filtering todo items based on status.

## WEB-120: Save users todo items
Save the todo items that a user has entered into the application so that even if the user reloads the page, he won't lose his todo list.

## WEB-203: Replace lib/state.js
Actually I have created this application using React and Redux. Which is the most effective solution to work with state and virtual DOM technology.

## WEB-301: Optimize the view rendering
I have used a large popular framework React instead of incremental-dom.
It's performance is many time faster than most of the common Frameworks. It's virtual DOM feature helps to load the content more faster than maximum template engine. JSX super charges it's performance. As a result I have used those powerful tools and technologies.
